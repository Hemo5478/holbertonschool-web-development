# CSS Styling Project

## Project Description

This project builds upon the HTML, Advanced project by applying full CSS styling to the webpage. The goal is to accurately recreate the design provided in Figma using clean, organized, and semantic CSS.

## Figma Design Reference

The layout and styling follow a designer file available in Figma.

**To view all design specifications:**

* Duplicate the file to your Drafts in Figma.
* Make sure to install missing fonts like Source Sans Pro and Spin Cycle OT.

## Tasks Overview

* Create `styles.css` and import it into `index.html`.
* Apply accurate styling to:
    * Header and hero section
    * Quote section
    * Videos list
    * Membership section
    * FAQ section
    * Footer
* Ensure the layout matches the Figma design as closely as possible.

## Technologies Used

* HTML5: For structure (from previous project)
* CSS3: For all styling
* Figma: As design reference

## Best Practices Followed

* Semantic and minimal selectors
* Centralized common styles
* Clean and readable CSS code
* Rounded float values for consistency

## Deployment

The final result is deployed using GitHub Pages for public access.
